#### Step 3:&#x20;

Start Minecraft in your launcher like you normally would, of course with Controllable installed too. Once the game has started, your controller should be automatically selected and work straight away. You can check if it's working correctly by navigating to the controller selection menu and you should see `Steam Virtual Gamepad` selected.
