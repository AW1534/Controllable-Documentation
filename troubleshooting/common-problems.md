# Common Problems

> "Controllable is not working at all!"

Controllable is a mod designed for the Forge modloader. If you are attempting to run the mod on another modloader like Fabric or Quilt, it will not work. If you are running Forge, verify that Controllable is installed. This can be checked from the mod list, which is accessed from the `Mods` button in the `Main Menu`. Use the search box and type in "Controllable", it should appear in the list.

> "Controllable is installed but my controller is not showing up"

Try using a different physical connection type if possible. If you're using Bluetooth, try switching to USB and vice versa. Otherwise, try a different method of [connecting your gamepad](../guides/how-to-connect-a-gamepad/).



> "My controller is detected by Controllable but the buttons are not mapped correctly"

If you are having an issue where your controller is appearing in game, but the buttons are not correctly mapped, this is simply due to incorrect or missing mappings. Mappings are special definitions that standardise the input from your controller.



> "My controller is working but it's sending double input"

Simply close Steam or disable the configuration for your controller in Big Picture.&#x20;

When the configuration _is_ enabled in Steam, it allows you to control your mouse and send keyboard input to your system. This happens on top of Controllabe's input handling, so if your right thumbstick is controlling the game camera, it may also be moving your real mouse cursor which also turns the game caemra.



> "My controller appears on Gamepad Tester ([https://gamepad-tester.com/](https://gamepad-tester.com/)) but not in-game"

Gamepad Tester uses libraries built into your browser. These libraries are not the same ones that are used in Controllable, which is why your controller may be detected on the site but not in-game.

The site is generally a quick method to test if your controller is having any input issues. Should your controller not appear in-game or not work correctly, please try different methods of [connecting your gamepad](../guides/how-to-connect-a-gamepad/).
