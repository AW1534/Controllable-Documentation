# Pitfalls

### Old Mappings

Due to how Controllable has been developed, the mappings in older versions of the mod may not include support for modern controllers. For example, the Playstation 5 controller was released after the `1.12.2` version of the mod. This means it's likely that the mapping will be incorrect or missing completely. This can be remedied by updating to modern versions of Controllable or by [manually updating the mappings](solving-incorrect-mappings.md) in the mod.
